My name is Sharath Macherla.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning is my passion. 

I have been learning Machine Learning since more than a couple of years.
currently, I am working on open source projects to build real-time skills.
My major interest areas in Machine Learning and deals mostly around with supervised and un-supervised learnings algorithms, Model Evaluation, Hyper Parameter tunings, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature selection, Outliers Detection, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization.
In deep Learning, Data Augmentation,  Building Neural Networks like ANN and CNN mostly. Also some other areas roughly skilled in computer vision, NLP, sql, Rasa, Handling Github and Git.
