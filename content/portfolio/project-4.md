Description: "Twitter is a social platform where most people tweets and express their opinions and facts,we pick any required query and find out the Sentimetal Analysis of it.:"

 - When you wanted the tweets, it contains many attributes like tweet date, user, user verified, user status count, fav count, rt count, user location and many more.

 - You can use the required attributes along with tweets.

 - api.search is limited to fetch the only 100 tweets at a time but tweepy.Cursor allows to fetch the tweets as many as of our desired. Here we need 1000 tweets so Cursor fetches 100 tweets and stores in a page and next fetches another 100 tweets and stores in a page as it goes on till the loop breaks.

 - Use clean tweet function using the regular expressions or other way to clean the tweets from the unnecessary symbols and special characters

 - textblob is module which has a in-built sentimental analysis property.

- From the length or number of positve, negative and neutral tweets, we can get to know the people opinions or facts about the query on this basis.
